                    <h2 class="mb-5">A Note on Work Experience</h2>
                    <p>My work history reflects the economic realities of being born trans and working-class in the United States. As Matthew Desmond argues in his book <i>Poverty, by America</i>, the richest country in the world chooses to impoverish almost 40 million of its own citizens. The one thing it does not lack is resources. Because of this, it could choose to end poverty within its borders if it wanted to. The problem is that it chooses not to. Furthermore, according to the 2022 U.S. Trans Survey, the poverty rate of trans people in the U.S. is approximately 34%. This is one of the highest poverty rates (if not the highest) of any group in the U.S. Despite the progress on trans rights and cultural acceptance over several years, there is still rampant discrimination against trans people, as evidenced in the high rates of poverty and homelessness and continued political attacks. While the U.S. frequently touts itself as a land of economic prosperity and a defender of liberty and freedom, for many trans Americans, that liberty and freedom, that economic prosperity, remains elusive, and what we have received instead is crushing economic precarity and instability, violence, discrimination, and a lack of bodily autonomy. To add insult to injury, in recent years, extremist political movements have used trans people as political pawns in the U.S. and abroad. This will only serve to exacerbate the poverty and economic precarity of trans people the world over. And unfortunately, all too often, poverty simply begets more poverty, regardless of what those living in poverty do or manage to accomplish. This is why my work history is that of a poor or working-class person and not someone born rich or middle-class.
